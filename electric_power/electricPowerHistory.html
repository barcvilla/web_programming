        <h2>Brief History of Electric Power</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Thomas Edison's first electric power plant generated 110-volt direct current (DC) for lighting and
            variable-speed machinery in nearby buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then Nikola tesla invented the alternating current (AC) induction motor and transformer. With constant
            AC frecuency, an introduction motor's speed cannot vary, but is cheaper and more durable than a
            DC motor.
        </p>
        <p>
            But not forever. In the middle of the 20th century, computer began consuming progressively more DC
            power.
        </p>
        <p>
            DC power, computer control, an the internet are helping the power grid accept variable renewable
            resource like wind and solar.

                <q>The test of our progress is not whether
                    we add more to the abundance of those wo have much it is whether we provide enough for those
                    who have little
