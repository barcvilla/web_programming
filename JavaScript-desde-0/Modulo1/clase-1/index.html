                There is a blessedness in reversion
                Blessed are the poor in spirit.
                MATTHEW 5: 3
                Having done with the occasion, I come now to the sermon itself.
                'Blessed are the poor in spirit'. Christ does not begin his Sermon on
                the Mount as the Law was delivered on the mount, with commands
                and threatenings, the trumpet sounding, the fire flaming, the earth
                quaking, and the hearts of the Israelites too for fear; but our Saviour
                (whose lips 'dropped as the honey-comb') begins with promises and
                blessings. So sweet and ravishing was the doctrine of this heavenly
                Orpheus that, like music, it was able to charm the most savage natures,
                yea, to draw hearts of stone to him.
                To begin then with this first word, 'Blessed''. If there be any blessedness
                in knowledge, it must needs be in the knowledge of blessedness.
                For the illustration of this, I shall lay down two aphorisms or conclusions.
                [ i ] That there is a blessedness in reversion.1
                [n] That the godly are in some sense already blessed.
                [ i ] That there is a blessedness in reversion: The people of God meet
                with many knotty difficulties and sinking discouragements in the way of
                religion. Their march is not only tedious but dangerous, and their hearts
                are ready to despond. It will not be amiss therefore to set the crown of
                blessedness before them to animate their courage and to inflame their
                zeal. How many scriptures bring this olive-branch in their mouth, the
                tidings of blessedness to believers! 'Blessed is that servant whom his
                Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing' (Matthew 24:46). 'Come,
                ye blessed of my Father' (Matthew 25:34). Blessedness is the perfection
                of a rational creature. It is the whetstone of a Christian's industry, the
                height of his ambition, the flower of his joy. Blessedness is the desire of
                all men. Aquinas calls it the 'ultimate end'. This is the 'white' every
                man aims to hit; to this centre all the lines are drawn.
                1 That is to say, the fulness of the blessedness lies in the future.
